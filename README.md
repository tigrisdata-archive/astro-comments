# Astro Starter Kit: Blog + Comments

Adding comments to your blog is a great way to engage with your readers. This repo contains the base Astro starter kit blog template with a few extra features:

- A `newcomment` Netlify function to handle saving comments to Tigris
- A `Comments` component to retrieve and display comments saved to Tigris
- A `NewComment` component to submit new comments to the Netlify function

# ‚òëÔ∏è To Do

Have suggestions or want to contribute? Here are a few things we'd love to see:

- Add a honeypot to the `NewComment` component to help prevent spam
- Add error checking in the `newcomment.ts` function
